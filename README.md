# Leptos + Mantine Example

Exploring the Leptos framework and attempting to use the [Mantine UI framework](https://mantine.dev/) in the process.

## Development

### Rust Environment
You'll need a (nightly) Rust toolchain installed to build and run the whole app.

I use `cocogitto` to keep pretty commits and changelogs and `cargo-leptos` for... well, Leptos.

```bash
cargo install cocogitto
cargo install --locked cargo-leptos
```
